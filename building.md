# Building

The current version \(2.3\) is an Ant-based Netbeans IDE project \(Netbeans 12, JDK 11\).

From Netbeans IDE:

* menu Team/Git/Clone, enter repository address **https://github.com/jjazzboss/JJazzLab-X.git**
* let Netbeans create a new project from the cloned files
* select the created project then right-click Build

**Note**: JJazzLab-X only embeds a very basic music generation for debugging purpose. See [www.jjazzlab.com](https://www.jjazzlab.com) for an example with a more powerful rhythm generation engine.
